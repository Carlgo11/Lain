### Minecraft server bot


## Background
Lain was my first Bukkit plugin that I made.  The idea behind the bot is to help manage the Minecraft server.  
I started developing the bot back in 2012.  
Around 2014 I decided to remake the bot as I had more knowledge of the Bukkit API and Java in general than what I did back in 2012.  
When Bukkit was put under a DMCA I moved away from Bukkit and the Minecraft server community in general.  
I have however recently (in 2016) gone over the code again just for fun.  
In Lain v2.1 I've focused a lot on documentation as version 2.0 didn't have any documentation which made it very hard to work with.  
I've also tried to hardcode as little as possible so that others can use my code for their own purposes without having to rewrite as much as before.

## Dependencies

- Bukkit API (alternatively an unofficial fork of the Bukkit API)
- Java JDK 7 or above
